## Hello, my name is Alexander Premo and I am currently an IT support specialist for Sunrun.

Technology is something that has been in my life as long as I can remember, I even recall recording youtube videos at 8 years old of me playing call of duty with a camcorder (I had no idea capture cards were even a thing :D). In college I studied Computer Information Systems with the goal of becoming a software engineer, unfortunately life does not always go as expected as I had family issues causing me to put this career on hold. Fortunately life always finds a way of working out as I ended up landing a "tech" job through luck of networking. Now I am back in love with this world and am devoting all my free time to learning cloud technologies as well as python. My goal moving forward is to become a DevOps engineer! Asides from technology I also spend my free time training boxing and jiu jitsu as not only do they keep me in shape, but they keep me grounded and humbled.
