## Hello, my name is Alexander Premo and I am currently a System Administrator for The Funded Trader.

Technology is something that has been in my life as long as I can remember, I even recall recording youtube videos at 8 years old of me playing call of duty with a camcorder (I had no idea capture cards were even a thing :D). In college I studied Computer Information Systems with the goal of breaking into tech. This was put on the backend as I was working 60 hours a week as a Security supervisor. Fortunately life always finds a way of working out as I ended up landing a "tech" job through luck of networking. Now I am back in love with this world and am devoting all my free time to learning cloud technologies as well as python. My goal moving forward is to break into cloud computing in 2023! Asides from technology I also spend my free time training boxing and jiu jitsu as not only do they keep me in shape, but they keep me grounded and humbled.
